### 1. Introduction

According to legal realist **Karl Llewellyn**, the law performs **five core societal functions**, each of which aims to maintain peace, resolve conflicts, accommodate change, define governance, and ensure justice through proper processes.

These functions are both **substantive** and **procedural**, impacting individuals and state institutions alike.

---

### 2. Preventing Disruptive Conflicts

Llewellyn asserts that law **“prevents disruptive conflicts within the community.”**

- **Law acts as a deterrent and a framework** for peacefully resolving disagreements.
- In the absence of effective legal systems, societies often spiral into **anarchy**, civil unrest, and large-scale violence.

#### Historical Examples:

- **Rwanda Genocide (1994):**
  - Resulted in over **1 million deaths** within 100 days.
  - Characterized by **mass rape**, **infrastructure collapse**, and **displacement**.
  - A collapse of law and order permitted mass atrocities.
  
- **Kenya’s Post-Election Violence (2007–2008):**
  - Triggered by a disputed presidential election.
  - Caused **loss of life**, **property destruction**, and **gender-based violence**.
  
- These events illustrate the **need for legal institutions** to maintain order and provide **mechanisms of redress**.

- The **Rome Statute**, establishing the **International Criminal Court (ICC)**, was adopted to:
  - **Prosecute crimes** such as genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.
  - Deter future crimes and restore international justice mechanisms.

### 3. Resolving Disputes

Law provides structured avenues for **dispute resolution**, distinguishing between:

- **Civil Law** – Governs private disputes (e.g., contracts, torts, family law).
- **Criminal Law** – Involves offenses against the state (e.g., theft, murder).
- **Constitutional Law** – Protects individuals from state overreach and defends fundamental rights.

#### Examples of Dispute Types:

- **Contract Law** – Covers enforceable promises. (Black’s Law Dictionary defines a contract as: _“a promise, or set of promises, for which the law gives a remedy...”_)
- **Family Law** – Covers marriage, divorce, child custody, and guardianship.
- **Law of Succession** – Regulates inheritance matters for deceased persons.
- **Law of Torts** – Governs civil wrongs like defamation, negligence, and trespass.

These legal domains create **predictability** and **structure**, making social coexistence viable.

### 4. Accommodating Social Change

Law evolves to **reflect the values and needs** of a changing society.

#### Key Examples:

- **Emancipation Proclamation (1863)** – Issued by U.S. President **Abraham Lincoln**, abolished slavery for 3 million+ individuals.
- **Thirteenth Amendment (1865)** – Formally outlawed slavery in the U.S.
  
- **Kenya’s SIM Registration Law (Act No. 41 of 2013)** – Modernized telecommunications law in response to mobile technology growth.
- **Repeal of Section 2A (1991)** – Enabled Kenya’s transition to **multi-party democracy**.
- **2010 Constitution of Kenya** – Replaced centralized governance with **devolution** to enhance democracy and accountability.

#### Regional Integration:

- **Articles of Union (Tanganyika & Zanzibar, 1964)** – Formed Tanzania.
- **Acts of Union (UK, 1707 & 1801)** – Unified England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland into the **United Kingdom**.

These events show that law is not static but **responsive to political, technological, and social transformations**.

### 5. Establishing Authority Structures

Llewellyn recognizes that law also **structures governance**.

#### What is a Constitution?

> **Narrow Definition**: A legal document outlining the **framework and powers** of a government.  
> **Broader Definition**: A **set of laws, conventions, and principles** that determine how a state functions.

Examples:

- **UK Constitution** – Largely unwritten, based on **conventions**, **statutes**, and **common law**.
- **Doctrine of Parliamentary Sovereignty** – The **UK Parliament** is supreme over the executive and judiciary.

Contrast with:

- **U.S. Constitution (1787)** – Written document emphasizing **Constitutional Supremacy** and **Separation of Powers**.
  - Executive: President
  - Legislature: Senate and House of Representatives
  - Judiciary: Supreme Court

Kenya’s **2010 Constitution** mirrors the U.S. model by separating powers and upholding a written **supreme law**.

### 6. Laying Down Procedural Rules

> "Procedure is the handmaid of justice."

#### Substantive vs. Procedural Law:

- **Substantive Law** – Defines legal rights and obligations (e.g., Penal Code).
- **Procedural Law** – Dictates how legal processes are carried out (e.g., Criminal Procedure Code, Civil Procedure Act).

#### Examples:

- **Criminal Law**:
  - **Penal Code (Cap 63)** – Defines crimes and penalties.
  - **Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 75)** – Guides arrest, prosecution, and trial procedures.
  
- **Civil Law**:
  - **Law of Succession (Cap 160)**
  - **Marriage Act (No. 4 of 2014)**
  - **Land Act (No. 6 of 2012)**
  - **Civil Procedure Act (Cap 21)** – Main procedural law for civil litigation.

#### Lex Specialis Principle:
> _Lex specialis derogat legi generali_ – A **specific law** overrides a **general one** when both apply to the same issue.

This principle ensures that more targeted legal rules are prioritized over generic frameworks.

#### On Procedural Fairness:

Clark observed:
> _“Regular procedure is necessary to secure equal treatment for all; it is necessary... to avoid favoritism and maintain impartiality.”_

This underscores **equality before the law** and the importance of **predictability** in adjudication.

### 7. Alternative Views on the Functions of Law

While Karl Llewellyn presents a detailed five-fold framework, other scholars offer alternate views.

#### Burnett's Classification:
1. **Structuring and controlling public power**
2. **Facilitating and effectuating private choice**
3. **Resolving social conflict**

These roles overlap with Llewellyn's taxonomy but offer different phrasing and emphases, showing that **legal philosophy is dynamic and context-sensitive**.

---

### 8. Conclusion

Law is a **multi-dimensional tool** that serves individuals, communities, and states. Whether it is **preventing conflict**, **resolving disputes**, **accommodating change**, **structuring government**, or **enforcing fairness through procedure**, the law touches every facet of organized life.

Llewellyn’s functions, backed by **historical experience**, **jurisprudential principles**, and **practical legislation**, affirm law’s essential place in **building and sustaining a just society**.
