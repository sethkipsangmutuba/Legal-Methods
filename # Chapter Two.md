## History

Kenya was declared a British protectorate on 1 July 1895. This resulted in the movement of British subjects from Britain and the Indian colony to Kenya. The arrival of the British citizens also marked the beginning of the application of English laws in Kenya, though initially only applicable to British subjects.

In 1897, the British laws were officially received in Kenya. The applicable laws were those in force in England as of **12 August 1897**. The Reception Clause stated:

> "So far as circumstances admit… in conformity with the Civil Procedure and Penal Codes of India and the other Indian Acts which are in force in the Colony… and subject thereto and so far as the same shall not extend or apply shall be exercised in conformity with the substance of the common law, the doctrines of equity and the statutes of general application in force in England on the 12th day of August 1897,"

These laws were to be adjusted to the local environment as reflected in the proviso:

> "Provided always that the said common law doctrines of equity and the statutes of general application shall be in force in the colony so far only as the circumstances of the colony and its inhabitants permit and subject to such qualifications as local circumstances render necessary."

However, English judges often disregarded customary law, considering it inferior, and they failed to adjust common law to suit the Kenyan context. **Lord Denning**, in *Nyali Ltd. v. Attorney-General* [1955] 1 A.E.R. 646, at 653, observed:

> "The next proviso says… that the common law is to apply 'subject to such qualification as local circumstances render necessary'. This wise provision should, I think, be liberally construed... Just as with an English oak, so with the English common law... In these far-off lands the people must have a law which they understand and which they will respect..."

---

## East African Order in Council, 1902

In 1902, the **East African Order in Council** extended certain Indian Acts to Kenya. Article 15 stated:

> "... all civil and criminal jurisdiction shall, so far as circumstances admit, be exercised in conformity with the Indian Acts… and so far as the same shall not extend or apply shall be exercised in conformity with the substance of the common law, the doctrines of equity and the statutes of general application in force in England on August, 1897…"

This provision was reaffirmed by the 1911 Order in Council.

---

## System of Courts and Laws

### Supreme Court

The Supreme Court was established to administer English law. Professional judges were brought in from the United Kingdom to preside over the court.

### Subordinate Courts

These courts functioned below the Supreme Court. While some judges were professional lawyers, many magistrates were administrative officers like **Provincial Commissioners, District Commissioners**, and **District Officers**.

### Dual System of Courts

The system was dualistic:
- **English courts** administered English law.
- **Native courts** (for the “natives”) applied customary law.

### Native Court System

The **Native Tribunals**, established under the Native Tribunals Ordinance, administered customary law. Section 13(a) stated:

> "The native law and custom prevailing in the area of the jurisdiction of the tribunal, so far as it is not repugnant to justice or morality or inconsistent with the provisions of any Order in Council or with any other law in force in the Colony."

The **Kenya Colony Order in Council, 1921**, expanded the application of customary law. Article 4(2) declared:

> "In all cases civil and criminal to which natives are parties, every court… shall be guided by native law and custom so far as it is applicable and is not repugnant to justice or morality or inconsistent with any Order in Council or Ordinance in force."

**Appeal structure**:
- Native Tribunal → Native Court of Appeal → District Commissioner → Provincial Commissioner

---

## African Courts Ordinance, 1951

The Native Tribunals were restructured and renamed **African Courts**. Appeal structure became:

- African Courts → African Appeal Court → District Commissioner → Court of Review

The **Court of Review** consisted of:
- A chairman of high judicial standing (appointed by the Chief Justice)
- The Chief Native Commissioner
- The African Courts Officer
- One African appointed by the Governor

---

## Criminal Law

The **Indian Penal Code** was used in Kenya until 1930, when it was replaced by the **Penal Code of 1930**.

- Native Criminal Law was originally supervised by district officers.
- Later, **Native Tribunals** were granted authority to hear certain offences under the Penal Code.

---

# The Present Legal System of Kenya

## Sources of Law

The sources of law in Kenya are codified under **Section 3 of the Judicature Act**, Chapter 8 of the Laws of Kenya.

### Constitution

According to **Section 3(1)**, all courts in Kenya must exercise their jurisdiction in conformity with:

1. **The Constitution** – the supreme law of the land.

### Written Law

2. **All other written laws**, including:
   - Acts of Parliament (Kenyan laws)
   - Modified Acts of the UK Parliament as listed in the First Schedule to the Judicature Act.

### Common Law and Doctrines of Equity

3. **Common law, doctrines of equity, and statutes of general application** in force in England on **12 August 1897**, only apply:
   - Where no written law covers the matter.
   - As far as they suit the circumstances of Kenya.

> 📝 *Note*: These are applied with necessary qualifications to suit Kenya’s local context.

### Customary Law

Customary law is recognized, but **not binding**. Courts may apply it **only if**:
- It is **not repugnant to justice or morality**.
- It is **not inconsistent with written law** (Judicature Act, Section 3(2)).

### International Law

The **2010 Constitution** recognizes international law:

> **Article 2(5):** “The general rules of international law shall form part of the law of Kenya.”

> **Article 2(6):** “Any treaty or convention ratified by Kenya shall form part of the law of Kenya under this Constitution.”

### UK Statutes in the Judicature Act

Section 3(1)(b) lists UK Acts still in effect:

- Admiralty Offences (Colonial) Act 1849  
- Evidence Act 1851 (Sections 7 and 11)  
- Foreign Tribunals Evidence Act 1856  
- Evidence by Commission Act 1859  
- British Law Ascertainment Act 1859  
- Admiralty Offences (Colonial) Act 1860  
- Foreign Law Ascertainment Act 1861  
- Conveyancing (Scotland) Act 1874 (Section 51)  
- Evidence by Commission Act 1885  

> ⚠️ *These British statutes are outdated and should be replaced with modern local legislation. The Law Reform Commission has a duty to prioritize this review.*

---

## Court System

The hierarchy of Kenyan courts is as follows:

- 🔹 **Supreme Court**
- 🔹 **Court of Appeal**
- 🔹 **High Court** and courts with its status:
  - Employment and Labour Relations Court
  - Environment and Land Court
- 🔹 **Subordinate Courts**

Under **Article 162 of the Constitution**, the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, High Court, and its counterparts are classified as **Superior Courts**.

---

## The Supreme Court

Established under **Article 163 of the Constitution**, it is the **highest court in Kenya**.

### Composition

- Chief Justice – President of the Supreme Court  
- Deputy Chief Justice – Vice-President  
- Five other Judges – Appointed by the President on recommendation from the Judicial Service Commission

### Jurisdiction

Outlined in **Article 163(3)** and includes:

>  In *The Matter of Interim Independent Electoral Commission* [2011] eKLR, the court defined advisory opinion as:

> “Legal advice rendered by the Court to a public body... not flowing from a contest of rights... thus not a judgment or decree but still a **binding decision** under Article 163(7).”

### Binding Nature

The court held that:
> “An advisory opinion is a decision of the court... binding on those who seek it, and upon lower courts, in the same way as other decisions.”

### Difference from Attorney-General's Advice

- The Attorney-General’s advice (Article 156) **is not binding**.
- Supreme Court advisory opinions **are binding**.

   - National government  
   - State organ  
   - County government  
3. **Court discretion**:
   - Will not render opinion if matter is already before a lower court unless in public interest
4. **Urgency/public importance**:

## 1. Introduction

Customary law remains a foundational source of law in Kenya. It governs various aspects of civil life and exists alongside common law, Islamic law, and statutory law. The Judicature Act of Kenya formally acknowledges customary law as applicable in certain circumstances, particularly civil matters involving parties subject to such customs.

---

## 2. Customary Law under the Judicature Act

Section 3(2) of the **Judicature Act** states:

> _“The Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, the High Court, the Environment and Land Court, the Employment and Labour Relations Court and all subordinate courts shall be guided by African customary law in civil cases in which one or more of the parties is subject to it or affected by it, so far as it is applicable and is not repugnant to justice and morality or inconsistent with any written law...”_

Key Takeaways:
- Courts are **guided**, not **bound**, by customary law.
- Customary law applies if **relevant to the parties** involved.
- It must pass the **repugnancy and consistency test**.

---

## 3. Colonial Courts and Customary Law

During colonial rule, a **dual legal system** existed:
- **Native Tribunals** applied customary law to Africans.
- **Colonial Courts** applied English law.

Example:
- The **Native Tribunal Ordinance** and **Kenya Order in Council 1921** allowed courts to apply customary law _unless_ it was **repugnant** or **inconsistent** with formal statutes.

---

## 4. Repugnancy Test and Judicial Attitudes

Colonial courts often dismissed African customs as immoral or backward:
- In **Rex v. Amkeyo (1917)**, **Hamilton, C.J.** described African marriages as "wife-purchase" and not valid marriages.
- In **Gwao Bin Kilimo v. Kisunda Bin Ifuti (1938)**, **Wilson, J.** rejected a custom requiring a father to pay for a son’s crimes, calling it unjust.

---

## 5. Criminal Offences and Customary Law

Initially, native tribunals handled some criminal matters, but:
- **Phillips Report (1944)** criticized native criminal justice.
- Over time, **Penal Code** replaced customary criminal laws.
- By **independence**, only **10 customary criminal offences** remained.

---

## 6. Government Efforts to Restate Customary Law

Efforts to document customary laws led to:
- **Restatement of African Law – Kenya (Marriage & Divorce)**, 1968
- **Restatement of African Law – Kenya (Succession)**, 1968

This preserved the customs for use in civil cases and made them intelligible to courts.

---

## 7. Post-Independence Court Approach

After independence, judicial attitudes improved:
- In **Kimani v. Gikanga (1965)**, the court reaffirmed that customary law is part of Kenya’s legal system.
- In **Muli v. Kithuka (1969)**, **Miller J.** emphasized that marriages under customary law are **not inferior** to statutory ones.

---

## 8. Key Judicial Pronouncements

### Repugnancy Reconsidered:
In **Kamau v. Wanja (1974)**, a Kikuyu custom allowing a widow to remarry was upheld by **Kneller, J.**

### The Otieno Burial Case:
**Virginia Edith Wambui Otieno v. Joash Ochieng Ougo (1987)** – Court held that:
- A Luo man must be buried according to clan customs.
- Personal wishes may not override **clan burial traditions**.

---

## 9. Development and Flexibility of Customary Law

### Judicial Reforms and Flexibility

#### Re Kibiego (1972):
**Madan J.** appointed a widow as estate administrator despite contrary Nandi customs.  
> _"A legal system ought to march with the changing conditions fitting itself into the aspirations of the people it is supposed to serve."_

#### Peter Hinga v. Mary Wanjiku (1977):
Even though **Ngurario** (dowry rite) wasn't performed, the court upheld the existence of a valid marriage due to long cohabitation and children born.

### Modern Interpretation:

In **Martha Wanjiru Kimata v. Dorcas Wanjiru (2015)** and **Ruth Wanjiru Njoroge v. Jemimah Njeri Njoroge (2004)**, courts emphasized:
- The **dynamic nature** of customary law.
- The **legal proximity** to the deceased, especially in burial disputes, often favors the spouse over clan demands.

---

## 10. Conclusion

Kenya’s legal system is a **hybrid**:
- **Dominated by Common Law**, but also includes:
  - **Customary law** (civil matters, family law, succession)
  - **Islamic law** (family matters, inheritance)
  - **Hindu law** (limited application)

The courts continue to evolve in their interpretation of customary law, balancing:
- Respect for tradition
- Protection of individual rights
- The demands of a modern constitutional democracy

---

> _“Customary law, like all law, must remain responsive to the society it serves.”_
