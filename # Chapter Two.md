## History

Kenya was declared a British protectorate on 1 July 1895. This resulted in the movement of British subjects from Britain and the Indian colony to Kenya. The arrival of the British citizens also marked the beginning of the application of English laws in Kenya, though initially only applicable to British subjects.

In 1897, the British laws were officially received in Kenya. The applicable laws were those in force in England as of **12 August 1897**. The Reception Clause stated:

> "So far as circumstances admit… in conformity with the Civil Procedure and Penal Codes of India and the other Indian Acts which are in force in the Colony… and subject thereto and so far as the same shall not extend or apply shall be exercised in conformity with the substance of the common law, the doctrines of equity and the statutes of general application in force in England on the 12th day of August 1897,"

These laws were to be adjusted to the local environment as reflected in the proviso:

> "Provided always that the said common law doctrines of equity and the statutes of general application shall be in force in the colony so far only as the circumstances of the colony and its inhabitants permit and subject to such qualifications as local circumstances render necessary."

However, English judges often disregarded customary law, considering it inferior, and they failed to adjust common law to suit the Kenyan context. **Lord Denning**, in *Nyali Ltd. v. Attorney-General* [1955] 1 A.E.R. 646, at 653, observed:

> "The next proviso says… that the common law is to apply 'subject to such qualification as local circumstances render necessary'. This wise provision should, I think, be liberally construed... Just as with an English oak, so with the English common law... In these far-off lands the people must have a law which they understand and which they will respect..."

## East African Order in Council, 1902

In 1902, the **East African Order in Council** extended certain Indian Acts to Kenya. Article 15 stated:

> "... all civil and criminal jurisdiction shall, so far as circumstances admit, be exercised in conformity with the Indian Acts… and so far as the same shall not extend or apply shall be exercised in conformity with the substance of the common law, the doctrines of equity and the statutes of general application in force in England on August, 1897…"

This provision was reaffirmed by the 1911 Order in Council.

## System of Courts and Laws

### Supreme Court

The Supreme Court was established to administer English law. Professional judges were brought in from the United Kingdom to preside over the court.

### Subordinate Courts

These courts functioned below the Supreme Court. While some judges were professional lawyers, many magistrates were administrative officers like **Provincial Commissioners, District Commissioners**, and **District Officers**.

### Dual System of Courts

The system was dualistic:
- **English courts** administered English law.
- **Native courts** (for the “natives”) applied customary law.

### Native Court System

The **Native Tribunals**, established under the Native Tribunals Ordinance, administered customary law. Section 13(a) stated:

> "The native law and custom prevailing in the area of the jurisdiction of the tribunal, so far as it is not repugnant to justice or morality or inconsistent with the provisions of any Order in Council or with any other law in force in the Colony."

The **Kenya Colony Order in Council, 1921**, expanded the application of customary law. Article 4(2) declared:

> "In all cases civil and criminal to which natives are parties, every court… shall be guided by native law and custom so far as it is applicable and is not repugnant to justice or morality or inconsistent with any Order in Council or Ordinance in force."

**Appeal structure**:
- Native Tribunal → Native Court of Appeal → District Commissioner → Provincial Commissioner

## African Courts Ordinance, 1951

The Native Tribunals were restructured and renamed **African Courts**. Appeal structure became:

- African Courts → African Appeal Court → District Commissioner → Court of Review

The **Court of Review** consisted of:
- A chairman of high judicial standing (appointed by the Chief Justice)
- The Chief Native Commissioner
- The African Courts Officer
- One African appointed by the Governor

## Criminal Law

The **Indian Penal Code** was used in Kenya until 1930, when it was replaced by the **Penal Code of 1930**.

- Native Criminal Law was originally supervised by district officers.
- Later, **Native Tribunals** were granted authority to hear certain offences under the Penal Code.
