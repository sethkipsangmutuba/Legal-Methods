### 1. Introduction

Legal education in Kenya begins directly at the undergraduate level, unlike in countries such as the **United States** or **India**, where a **first degree** in another field is typically required before studying law.

Legal practice in Kenya is reserved exclusively for **Advocates**—persons who:
- Hold a **Bachelor of Laws (LL.B)** degree from a recognized institution,
- Have successfully completed the **Advocates’ Training Programme** at the **Kenya School of Law (KSL)**,
- Have been admitted to the **Roll of Advocates** by the **Chief Justice** upon a successful petition,
- And hold a valid **Practising Certificate**.

---

### 2. Distinction Between a Lawyer and an Advocate

There exists a **key distinction** between a **lawyer** and an **advocate** in Kenyan legal context:

- A **lawyer** is anyone who has obtained an LL.B degree.
- An **advocate**, as defined under the **Advocates Act**, is a person:
  > “…whose name is duly entered upon the Roll of Advocates or upon the Roll of Advocates having the rank of Senior Counsel…”

This means **not all lawyers are advocates**, but **all advocates are lawyers**.

Additionally, some **government officers** are **exempted** by law to act as advocates without being formally admitted:
- Officers from the **Attorney-General's Office**,
- Officers from the **Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP)**,
- **Registrars of Titles**,
- Some **public officers** gazetted by the Attorney-General,
- Officials from **local authorities** under the now repealed Local Government Act.

---

### 3. Legal Education Pathway in Kenya

#### 3.1 Entry Requirements

To qualify for entry into a **Bachelor of Laws (LL.B)** programme in Kenya, a student must:

- Hold a **KCSE Mean Grade of C+**, with at least **B (plain)** in English or Kiswahili,  
**or**
- Hold a **Diploma in Law** from a recognized institution,  
**or**
- Present equivalent academic qualifications approved by the **Council of Legal Education (CLE)**.

#### 3.2 Bachelor of Laws (LL.B) Degree

- Duration: **4 years**
- Offered by public and private universities accredited by the **Commission for University Education (CUE)** and **CLE**.

  - Constitutional Law
  - Criminal Law
  - Contract Law
  - Law of Torts
  - Property Law
  - Equity & Trusts
  - Legal Research and Writing

#### 3.3 Advocates Training Programme (ATP)

After graduation, a prospective advocate must enroll in the **Kenya School of Law (KSL)** for the **ATP**, which includes:

- **Coursework and Practical Training** in:
  - Civil & Criminal Litigation
  - Legal Writing and Drafting
  - Professional Ethics
  - Legal Practice Management
- **Pupilage** (6 months in a law firm or organization)
- **Bar Examinations** administered by the **Council of Legal Education (CLE)**

Passing the ATP is a **mandatory prerequisite** for admission to the bar.

---

### 4. Admission to the Bar

Upon successful completion of the ATP, the candidate must:

1. **Petition the Chief Justice** for admission.
2. Be vetted and approved by the **Council of Legal Education**.
3. Attend a formal **admission ceremony** before the **High Court of Kenya**.
4. Have their name entered into the **Roll of Advocates**.

Only after this process can one be referred to legally as an **Advocate of the High Court of Kenya**.

---

### 5. Practising as an Advocate

#### 5.1 Practising Certificate

Admission alone does **not entitle** one to practice law. To **actively practice**, an advocate must:

- Apply for and be issued an **Annual Practising Certificate** under **Section 24 of the Advocates Act**.
- This certificate must be **renewed every year**.
- Without this certificate, an advocate is considered **unqualified to offer legal services**, even if admitted.

#### 5.2 Practising Without Qualification

Practising law without a valid Practising Certificate or without being duly admitted is a **criminal offence** under the **Advocates Act**, with potential consequences including:

- **Fines and imprisonment**
- **Striking off the Roll**
- **Reputational damage**
- Invalidation of legal proceedings conducted by such a person

---

### 6. Special Categories of Advocates

Some officers can **act as advocates without being formally admitted**, as permitted by **statutory exceptions**. These include:

- **State Law Officers**: such as those from the **Attorney-General's office** or **ODPP**.
- **Registrars**: such as **Registrars of Titles** dealing with property law.
- **Gazetted Public Officers**: designated by the **Attorney-General** to act in legal capacities.

However, such officers can **only act within the scope of their official duties** and not in private legal practice.

# Qualification to Study Law in Kenya

### 1. Introduction

The study of law in Kenya is **direct-entry** from high school, meaning it is undertaken as a **first degree** (Bachelor of Laws – LL.B). This differs from some jurisdictions such as the **United States** and **India**, where a student must first earn a **non-law undergraduate degree** before qualifying to study law at graduate level.

---

### 2. Qualification to Study Law in Kenya

A **form four leaver** who has sat for the **Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE)** and scored a **minimum mean grade of C+** is eligible to apply for an undergraduate degree in law in any **public or private university** in Kenya.

However, since most LL.B graduates are expected to proceed to the **Kenya School of Law (KSL)** for the **Advocates Training Programme (ATP)**, the **language requirements** set for the ATP have been **cascaded down** to undergraduate law admission as well.

---

### 3. Role of the Commission for University Education (CUE)

The **Commission for University Education (CUE)** is the statutory body responsible for setting **minimum standards for admission** into university programmes in Kenya.  

- It is established under **Section 4 of the Universities Act, 2022**.
- Through **Rule 11** of the **Universities (Establishment of the Universities) (Standardization, Accreditation and Supervision) Rules, 1989**, CUE developed:
  > **“Standards and Guidelines for University Programmes.”**

Under **Rule 7** of the guidelines, the minimum admission requirements into **undergraduate degree programmes** (including law) are outlined.

---

### 4. Minimum Admission Requirements

Below are the approved pathways for admission into a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B) programme:

- **KCSE Route**:  
  - Minimum **mean grade of C+**

---

### 5. Additional Academic Requirements

> **The Legal Education (Accreditation and Quality Assurance) Regulations, 2016**

According to **Paragraph 5 of the Third Schedule**, the **minimum qualifications** for entry into an undergraduate law programme include:

- **KCSE Graduates**:

# LAW DEGREE CURRICULUM AND ADVOCATES TRAINING PROGRAMME

---

### 1. Introduction

- **Section 18**, and  
- **Section 19** of the **Legal Education Act, 2012**.

The **curriculum for law schools** must comply with the statutory content requirements set out by the CLE. Failure to do so invalidates a university’s license to teach law.

---

---

### 4. Optional Courses

Universities are permitted to add **supplementary or elective courses** in addition to the 16 core units, depending on their institutional focus and resources. However, these must not substitute or override the required core curriculum.

---

### 5. Advocates Training Programme (ATP)

---

### 6. Admission to the Advocates Training Programme

Admission to the ATP requires **both academic and citizenship qualifications.**

#### A. Academic Qualifications

Set out under **The Legal Education (Accreditation and Quality Assurance) Regulations, 2016**, specifically **Paragraph 5 of the Third Schedule**:

To qualify for ATP, one must have:

- A **Bachelor of Laws (LL.B)** degree from a **recognized university**  
- Where applicable, a **Certificate of Completion** of a **remedial program**  
- **Proof of academic progression** in accordance with regulations  
- A **Certificate of Completion** of the **Pre-Bar Examination** (administered by KSL)

> ⚠️ The LL.B degree must comply with minimum requirements including:  
> - **C+ mean grade** in KCSE  
> - **B (plain)** in English or Kiswahili  

#### B. Kenya School of Law Entry Criteria

The Kenya School of Law admits students who:

- Hold an LL.B degree from a recognized university (or awaiting conferment after final exams)  
- Attained the **minimum entry requirement** for admission to a Kenyan university  
- Scored **B (plain)** in **English or Kiswahili** and a **mean grade of C+** in KCSE  
- Have **passed the Pre-Bar Exam** administered by KSL

---

# LANGUAGE AND NATIONALITY REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION TO THE ADVOCATES TRAINING PROGRAMME

---

### 1. English or Kiswahili KCSE Requirement

The **Legal Education (Accreditation and Quality Assurance) Regulations, 2016**, make it **mandatory** for any applicant seeking admission to the Advocates Training Programme (ATP) at the Kenya School of Law to have scored **a minimum of B (plain)** in either:

- **English**, or  
- **Kiswahili**,  

in their **Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE)** examinations.

---

### 2. Academic Progression Argument

Some prospective students have attempted to circumvent this strict requirement by relying on **"academic progression"**, a term referenced in **Paragraphs 3 and 4** of the Accreditation Regulations. The argument is that remedial qualifications, such as:

- A **Certificate in Law**, or  
- A **Diploma in Law**,  

could make up for the language grade deficiency. However, this argument has **consistently failed in court**.

---

### 3. Court of Appeal Ruling – *KSL vs Otene & Others*

In the **Court of Appeal decision** of **Nairobi CACA No. E472 of 2021 – *Kenya School of Law vs Otene Richard Akomo & 41 Others***, the issue was squarely addressed.

**Holding**:
> "Failure to meet the basic requirements of the qualifications in KCSE as envisaged renders one’s application incompetent... The regulations cannot override the provisions of an Act of Parliament."

Despite having a favorable judgment in the **High Court**, the respondents’ hopes were dashed when the **Court of Appeal overturned the ruling**, affirming the **B (plain) in English or Kiswahili** as **non-negotiable**.

---

### 4. Equivalency for Foreign Candidates

For those with **foreign secondary school qualifications**, the **Kenya National Qualifications Authority (KNQA)** is tasked with determining **equivalency**.

Example:
- A student from Uganda or South Africa would submit their certificate to KNQA, which would then equate their English grade to the KCSE standard. If it does **not match B (plain)**, the applicant is **not eligible**.

---

### 5. Nationality and Bar Admission

Beyond academic qualifications, **citizenship** also plays a role.

#### Legal Framework:
- **Section 12 of the Advocates Act (Cap 16)** provides that **only citizens** of:
  - **Kenya**
  - **Uganda**
  - **Tanzania**
  - **Rwanda**
  - **Burundi**

  are automatically eligible to be admitted as Advocates of the High Court of Kenya.

---

### 6. Discrimination and Case Law

Several cases have challenged the **restrictive interpretation** of Section 12, arguing that it is **discriminatory** and violates **Article 27 of the Constitution** (equality and freedom from discrimination).

#### ✅ Case 1:  
**Steve Isaack Kawai & 2 Others v Council of Legal Education & 2 Others [2021] eKLR**

> Petitioners were **South Sudanese refugees** who had studied in Kenya from primary school to university. They had even completed the ATP but were barred from sitting the bar exams.

**Court held**:
> _"Citizens of South Sudan should not be excluded from the benefits available to citizens of other EAC countries simply because South Sudan joined later. The denial of rights based on timing of accession to the EAC is unconstitutional."_

---

#### ✅ Case 2:  
**Jonnah Tusasirwe & 10 Others v Council of Legal Education & 3 Others [2017] eKLR**

- Included applicants from countries **not listed** under Section 12.
- The Kenya School of Law had **previously admitted** students from **Cameroon, Nigeria, Gambia**, etc.

**Court held**:
> _"The denial of admission on nationality grounds was unsupported by statute and unconstitutional. Past precedence and the plain meaning of the law support inclusivity."_  
> _"The decision of the CLE is null and void."_

---

### 7. Conclusion

#### ⚖️ Summary:
- The **language requirement (B plain)** in **English or Kiswahili** at KCSE (or equivalent) is **compulsory**.
- There is **no legal workaround or substitute**, not even with a diploma or certificate.
- The requirement applies **equally** to graduates from **Kenyan and foreign universities**.
- On **nationality**, while the statute limits eligibility to EAC citizens, **judicial interpretation has expanded** the scope, enabling **non-EAC nationals** to access ATP and subsequently qualify for bar admission in Kenya.

#### 📌 Final Word:
The **legal and judicial frameworks** underscore Kenya’s intent to **uphold quality and equality** in its legal profession. Prospective candidates must comply strictly with both **academic and nationality** requirements, although **courts have ensured fairness and inclusivity** where discriminatory gaps exist in the law.
