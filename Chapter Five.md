### 1. Introduction

Legal education in Kenya begins directly at the undergraduate level, unlike in countries such as the **United States** or **India**, where a **first degree** in another field is typically required before studying law.

Legal practice in Kenya is reserved exclusively for **Advocates**—persons who:
- Hold a **Bachelor of Laws (LL.B)** degree from a recognized institution,
- Have successfully completed the **Advocates’ Training Programme** at the **Kenya School of Law (KSL)**,
- Have been admitted to the **Roll of Advocates** by the **Chief Justice** upon a successful petition,
- And hold a valid **Practising Certificate**.

---

### 2. Distinction Between a Lawyer and an Advocate

There exists a **key distinction** between a **lawyer** and an **advocate** in Kenyan legal context:

- A **lawyer** is anyone who has obtained an LL.B degree.
- An **advocate**, as defined under the **Advocates Act**, is a person:
  > “…whose name is duly entered upon the Roll of Advocates or upon the Roll of Advocates having the rank of Senior Counsel…”

This means **not all lawyers are advocates**, but **all advocates are lawyers**.

Additionally, some **government officers** are **exempted** by law to act as advocates without being formally admitted:
- Officers from the **Attorney-General's Office**,
- Officers from the **Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP)**,
- **Registrars of Titles**,
- Some **public officers** gazetted by the Attorney-General,
- Officials from **local authorities** under the now repealed Local Government Act.

### 3. Legal Education Pathway in Kenya

#### 3.1 Entry Requirements

To qualify for entry into a **Bachelor of Laws (LL.B)** programme in Kenya, a student must:

- Hold a **KCSE Mean Grade of C+**, with at least **B (plain)** in English or Kiswahili,  
**or**
- Hold a **Diploma in Law** from a recognized institution,  
**or**
- Present equivalent academic qualifications approved by the **Council of Legal Education (CLE)**.

#### 3.2 Bachelor of Laws (LL.B) Degree

  - Civil & Criminal Litigation
  - Legal Writing and Drafting
  - Professional Ethics
  - Legal Practice Management
- **Pupilage** (6 months in a law firm or organization)
- **Bar Examinations** administered by the **Council of Legal Education (CLE)**

Passing the ATP is a **mandatory prerequisite** for admission to the bar.

---

### 4. Admission to the Bar

Upon successful completion of the ATP, the candidate must:

1. **Petition the Chief Justice** for admission.
2. Be vetted and approved by the **Council of Legal Education**.
3. Attend a formal **admission ceremony** before the **High Court of Kenya**.
4. Have their name entered into the **Roll of Advocates**.

Only after this process can one be referred to legally as an **Advocate of the High Court of Kenya**.

---

### 5. Practising as an Advocate

#### 5.1 Practising Certificate

Admission alone does **not entitle** one to practice law. To **actively practice**, an advocate must:

- Apply for and be issued an **Annual Practising Certificate** under **Section 24 of the Advocates Act**.
- This certificate must be **renewed every year**.
- Without this certificate, an advocate is considered **unqualified to offer legal services**, even if admitted.

#### 5.2 Practising Without Qualification

Practising law without a valid Practising Certificate or without being duly admitted is a **criminal offence** under the **Advocates Act**, with potential consequences including:

- **Fines and imprisonment**
- **Striking off the Roll**
- **Reputational damage**
- Invalidation of legal proceedings conducted by such a person

---

### 6. Special Categories of Advocates

Some officers can **act as advocates without being formally admitted**, as permitted by **statutory exceptions**. These include:

- **State Law Officers**: such as those from the **Attorney-General's office** or **ODPP**.
- **Registrars**: such as **Registrars of Titles** dealing with property law.
- **Gazetted Public Officers**: designated by the **Attorney-General** to act in legal capacities.

However, such officers can **only act within the scope of their official duties** and not in private legal practice.

# Qualification to Study Law in Kenya

### 1. Introduction

The study of law in Kenya is **direct-entry** from high school, meaning it is undertaken as a **first degree** (Bachelor of Laws – LL.B). This differs from some jurisdictions such as the **United States** and **India**, where a student must first earn a **non-law undergraduate degree** before qualifying to study law at graduate level.

### 2. Qualification to Study Law in Kenya

A **form four leaver** who has sat for the **Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE)** and scored a **minimum mean grade of C+** is eligible to apply for an undergraduate degree in law in any **public or private university** in Kenya.

However, since most LL.B graduates are expected to proceed to the **Kenya School of Law (KSL)** for the **Advocates Training Programme (ATP)**, the **language requirements** set for the ATP have been **cascaded down** to undergraduate law admission as well.

- It is established under **Section 4 of the Universities Act, 2022**.
- Through **Rule 11** of the **Universities (Establishment of the Universities) (Standardization, Accreditation and Supervision) Rules, 1989**, CUE developed:
  > **“Standards and Guidelines for University Programmes.”**

Under **Rule 7** of the guidelines, the minimum admission requirements into **undergraduate degree programmes** (including law) are outlined.
