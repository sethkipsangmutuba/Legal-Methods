## 1. History of the Civil Law Legal System

- The Civil Law system developed in **continental Europe** starting in the **11th century**.
- It traces its roots to **Roman Law**, which emerged around **450 BC**.
- Roman Law evolved from early social and legal debates between the nobility and commoners.

---

## 2. Development of Roman Law

- Around **450 BC**, Rome established **Twelve Tablets** â€” the earliest written principles of Roman law.
- Justice was administered by **patricians** (nobles), often approached via a **praetor**.
- Law interpretation was dominated by the **College of Pontiffs**, later succeeded by **juris consults**, who advised but did not judge.
- Legal writings were preserved on **papyrus rolls**, later codified into volumes (codices).
- Roman law spread with the empire and influenced territories like Germany and Britain but was abandoned after Rome's fall.

## 3. Construction of National Civilian Law

Milestones in codification:

- **France (1804)**: First systemic codification under **Napoleon** â€“ the **Napoleonic Code**.
- **Netherlands (1809)**: Adopted civil law codification.
- **Austria (1811)**: Introduced the **Austrian General Civil Code (ABGB)**.
- **Germany (1900)**: Developed a sophisticated **civil code (BGB)**.
- Preceded by efforts such as:
  - **Royal Ordinances of Louis XIV** (17th century France).
  - **National language legislation** (French law taught in French from the 16th century).

## 4. Main Characteristics of Civil Law System

### 4.1 Inquisitorial Procedure
- Judges play an **active role** in investigations and fact-finding.
- Unlike **adversarial common law**, judges do not just referee but **guide the case**.

### 4.2 Codification
- Laws are **comprehensively written and organized** into codes.
- Judges must **apply codified law**, not rely on precedent.

### 4.3 Non-binding Judgments
- Judicial decisions **only bind the parties** in that particular case.
- No doctrine of **binding precedent** as in common law.

Countries following the Civil Law system include:  
ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· France, ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Germany, ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ Japan, ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Italy, ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ Mexico, ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ China, and most of Europe and South America.

## 5. Comparison Between Civil Law and Common Law

| Feature | Civil Law | Common Law |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Origin** | Roman law, codified by Napoleon and others | English common law, evolved through case precedent |
| **Judgeâ€™s Role** | Inquisitorial â€“ active in finding facts and applying law | Adversarial â€“ referee between opposing lawyers |
| **Binding Precedent** | Judgments not binding on future cases | Precedent (stare decisis) is central |
| **Codification** | Extensive â€“ law is in codes | Case law and statutes coexist |
| **Main Countries** | France, Germany, Spain, Japan, etc. | UK, USA, Canada, Australia, India, etc. |
| **Source of Law** | 1. Constitution  2. Legislation  3. Custom  4. International Law | 1. Constitution (except UK)  2. Legislation  3. Judicial precedent  4. Custom |
| **Evidence Taking** | Judge-led; lawyers secondary | Lawyer-led; judge decides on evidence presented |
| **Evolution of Law** | Through state-led codification | Through precedent and statute |

---

## 6. Summary

- Civil law legal systems emphasize **codified law** over case precedent.
- Judges act as **investigators** rather than passive arbiters.
- The civil law tradition has shaped the legal systems of most of Europe, Latin America, and parts of Asia and Africa.
- Despite different structures, **civil and common law systems share similar legal sources** (statutes, customs, etc.) but **approach them differently**.

> _"Both systems aim at justice but differ in methods: Civil law looks inward to codes, common law outward to past decisions."_
