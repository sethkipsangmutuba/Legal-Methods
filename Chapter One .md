## Chapter One: Introduction

Any society has a system of rules and regulations that bind people in their daily interactions. These rules govern:

- **Voluntary interactions**, such as:
  - Marriage  
  - Employer-employee relationships  
  - Buyer-seller transactions  

- **Involuntary interactions**, such as:
  - Criminal-victim encounters, handled by the **criminal justice system**, which includes complex regulations and institutions for justice delivery.

---

## Forms of Social Interaction

Interactions in a society may either be:

- **Voluntary**: Entered into by mutual consent, like contracts or partnerships.  
- **Involuntary**: Arise out of necessity or breach of societal norms, such as crime and torts.

### Common Law Legal System

- Based on **judicial precedent** (case law).
- Found in countries like Kenya, USA, UK, Canada, and India.
- Judges play a central role in law development.

### Civil Law Legal System

- Originated in continental Europe (Roman law influence).
- Based on **codified statutes and comprehensive legal codes**.
- Used in France, Germany, Italy, and many Latin American countries.
- Judges apply law rather than create it.

### Islamic Law Legal System

- Based on the **Qur'an, Hadith, Ijma (consensus), and Qiyas (analogy)**.
- Applies in countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, and some regions of Kenya via Kadhis’ Courts.
- Emphasizes religious and moral rules.

### Customary Law Legal System

- Rooted in **community traditions, norms, and cultural practices**.
- Common in African societies before colonialism.
- Still applicable today under certain conditions (e.g. personal law, land, succession).
