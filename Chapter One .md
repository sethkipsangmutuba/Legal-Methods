## Chapter One: Introduction

Any society has a system of rules and regulations that bind people in their daily interactions. These rules govern:

- **Voluntary interactions**, such as:
  - Marriage  
  - Employer-employee relationships  
  - Buyer-seller transactions  

- **Involuntary interactions**, such as:
  - Criminal-victim encounters, handled by the **criminal justice system**, which includes complex regulations and institutions for justice delivery.

---

## Forms of Social Interaction

Interactions in a society may either be:

- **Voluntary**: Entered into by mutual consent, like contracts or partnerships.  
- **Involuntary**: Arise out of necessity or breach of societal norms, such as crime and torts.

## Definition of a Legal System

> A **Legal System** is the comprehensive institutional framework within which a society organizes and enforces rules and regulations to govern behavior, resolve disputes, and administer justice.

It includes:

- Rules and norms (laws)
- Institutions (courts, law enforcement, legislature)
- Procedures (due process, trial)
- Legal professionals (judges, lawyers, magistrates)

## Global Legal Systems

The world features **diverse legal systems** rooted in distinct historical, philosophical, and cultural traditions. The main families of legal systems are:

### Common Law Legal System

- Originated in England.
- Based on **judicial precedent** (case law).
- Found in countries like Kenya, USA, UK, Canada, and India.
- Judges play a central role in law development.

### Civil Law Legal System

- Originated in continental Europe (Roman law influence).
- Based on **codified statutes and comprehensive legal codes**.
- Used in France, Germany, Italy, and many Latin American countries.
- Judges apply law rather than create it.

### Islamic Law Legal System

- Based on the **Qur'an, Hadith, Ijma (consensus), and Qiyas (analogy)**.
- Applies in countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, and some regions of Kenya via Kadhis’ Courts.
- Emphasizes religious and moral rules.

### Customary Law Legal System

- Rooted in **community traditions, norms, and cultural practices**.
- Common in African societies before colonialism.
- Still applicable today under certain conditions (e.g. personal law, land, succession).
- Must conform to written law and principles of justice and morality under Kenyan law.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Describe** the concept of a legal system and basic legal terminology.
2. **Explain** the **Kenyan legal system**, its sources, and structure.
3. **Compare** various legal systems including their origins, features, and influence.

   - Access to justice.
   - Legal professions and ethical responsibilities.


## Definition of Terms

### What is Law?

There is no singular, universal definition of **law**, as the term encompasses various meanings depending on the context. However, one of the most respected and referenced sources for legal definitions is **Black’s Law Dictionary**, which outlines several interpretations:

1. **A system regulating human activities** through the structured application of force within an organized society.
2. **The body of legislation**, judicial precedents, and legal principles applied in courts.
3. A set of rules governing a **specific area of law** (e.g., copyright law).
4. **Legal procedures** and court processes (e.g., litigation).
5. A statute or written law passed by a legislative body.
6. The **Common Law** as distinct from Equity.
7. The **legal profession** itself.

These definitions are contextual—each is appropriate depending on the specific legal subject matter or situation being discussed.

### Schools of Thought

Over time, numerous legal scholars and schools of jurisprudence have attempted to define law based on different philosophies. Below is a comparative overview:

---

#### **Legal Positivism**

| Scholar | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **John Austin** | "A rule laid down for the guidance of an intelligent being by an intelligent being having power over him." Law is a **command** issued by a **sovereign**, backed by **sanctions**. |
| **H.L.A. Hart** | Defined law as a **"system of rules"** – specifically, a union of **primary rules** (obligations) and **secondary rules** (recognition, change, adjudication). See: *The Concept of Law* (1961). |

---

#### **Natural Law Theory**

| Scholar | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **Plato** | Law is the **embodiment of Reason**, either in the individual or society. |
| **Aristotle** | Saw law as a tool to foster **virtue** and justice. |
| **St. Thomas Aquinas** | "An ordinance of reason for the common good, made by one who has care of the community, and promulgated." (From *Summa Theologiae*, Q90 Art. 4) |

---

#### **Legal Realism**

| Scholar | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.** | "The prophecies of what the courts will do … are what I mean by the law." (*The Path of the Law*, 1920) |
| **Karl Llewellyn** | "Law is what officials do about disputes." |
| **Lord Browne-Wilkinson** | "The sum of the influences that determine decisions in courts of justice." |

---

#### **Marxist Theory of Law**

| Scholar | Viewpoint |
|--------|-----------|
| **Karl Marx** (and followers) | Law is a **tool of oppression**, used by the **ruling class** to control the **working class (proletariat)**. Legal systems are not neutral—they reflect the economic structure and perpetuate class struggles. |

---

#### **Sociological and Other Perspectives**

| Scholar | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **Max Weber** | "Law exists if it is externally guaranteed by the probability of coercion to bring about conformity, applied by a staff of people dedicated to enforcement." |
| **Thomas Hobbes** | In *Leviathan* (1651), law is "the formal glue that holds fundamentally disorganised societies together." |
| **Glanville Williams** | From *Learning the Law*: "Law is the cement of society and also an essential medium of change. Knowledge of law increases one’s understanding of public affairs..." |

---

### Summary Definition

Despite variation, the core function of law remains relatively consistent:

> **Law is a system of enforceable rules and principles, established by society or a sovereign authority, to regulate conduct, resolve disputes, and deliver justice.**

It performs key roles:

- **Regulates behavior**
- **Defines rights and duties**
- **Facilitates orderly change**
- **Protects freedoms and enforces responsibilities**
