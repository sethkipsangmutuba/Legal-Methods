## Chapter One: Introduction

Any society has a system of rules and regulations that bind people in their daily interactions. These rules govern:

- **Voluntary interactions**, such as:
  - Marriage  
  - Employer-employee relationships  
  - Buyer-seller transactions  

- **Involuntary interactions**, such as:
  - Criminal-victim encounters, handled by the **criminal justice system**, which includes complex regulations and institutions for justice delivery.

---

## Forms of Social Interaction

Interactions in a society may either be:

- **Voluntary**: Entered into by mutual consent, like contracts or partnerships.  
- **Involuntary**: Arise out of necessity or breach of societal norms, such as crime and torts.

---

## Definition of a Legal System

> A **Legal System** is the comprehensive institutional framework within which a society organizes and enforces rules and regulations to govern behavior, resolve disputes, and administer justice.

It includes:

- Rules and norms (laws)
- Institutions (courts, law enforcement, legislature)
- Procedures (due process, trial)
- Legal professionals (judges, lawyers, magistrates)

---

## Global Legal Systems

The world features **diverse legal systems** rooted in distinct historical, philosophical, and cultural traditions. The main families of legal systems are:

### Common Law Legal System

- Originated in England.
- Based on **judicial precedent** (case law).
- Found in countries like Kenya, USA, UK, Canada, and India.
- Judges play a central role in law development.

### Civil Law Legal System

- Originated in continental Europe (Roman law influence).
- Based on **codified statutes and comprehensive legal codes**.
- Used in France, Germany, Italy, and many Latin American countries.
- Judges apply law rather than create it.

### Islamic Law Legal System

- Based on the **Qur'an, Hadith, Ijma (consensus), and Qiyas (analogy)**.
- Applies in countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, and some regions of Kenya via Kadhis’ Courts.
- Emphasizes religious and moral rules.

### Customary Law Legal System

- Rooted in **community traditions, norms, and cultural practices**.
- Common in African societies before colonialism.
- Still applicable today under certain conditions (e.g. personal law, land, succession).
- Must conform to written law and principles of justice and morality under Kenyan law.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students should be able to:

1. **Describe** the concept of a legal system and basic legal terminology.
2. **Explain** the **Kenyan legal system**, its sources, and structure.
3. **Compare** various legal systems including their origins, features, and influence.
4. **Discuss** the **practice of law and delivery of legal services**, including:
   - Legal institutions and their roles.
   - Access to justice.
   - Legal professions and ethical responsibilities.


## Definition of Terms

### What is Law?

There is no singular, universal definition of **law**, as the term encompasses various meanings depending on the context. However, one of the most respected and referenced sources for legal definitions is **Black’s Law Dictionary**, which outlines several interpretations:

1. **A system regulating human activities** through the structured application of force within an organized society.
2. **The body of legislation**, judicial precedents, and legal principles applied in courts.
3. A set of rules governing a **specific area of law** (e.g., copyright law).
4. **Legal procedures** and court processes (e.g., litigation).
5. A statute or written law passed by a legislative body.
6. The **Common Law** as distinct from Equity.
7. The **legal profession** itself.

These definitions are contextual—each is appropriate depending on the specific legal subject matter or situation being discussed.

---

### Schools of Thought

Over time, numerous legal scholars and schools of jurisprudence have attempted to define law based on different philosophies. Below is a comparative overview:

---

#### **Legal Positivism**

| Scholar | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **John Austin** | "A rule laid down for the guidance of an intelligent being by an intelligent being having power over him." Law is a **command** issued by a **sovereign**, backed by **sanctions**. |
| **H.L.A. Hart** | Defined law as a **"system of rules"** – specifically, a union of **primary rules** (obligations) and **secondary rules** (recognition, change, adjudication). See: *The Concept of Law* (1961). |

---

#### **Natural Law Theory**

| Scholar | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **Plato** | Law is the **embodiment of Reason**, either in the individual or society. |
| **Aristotle** | Saw law as a tool to foster **virtue** and justice. |
| **St. Thomas Aquinas** | "An ordinance of reason for the common good, made by one who has care of the community, and promulgated." (From *Summa Theologiae*, Q90 Art. 4) |

---

#### **Legal Realism**

| Scholar | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.** | "The prophecies of what the courts will do … are what I mean by the law." (*The Path of the Law*, 1920) |
| **Karl Llewellyn** | "Law is what officials do about disputes." |
| **Lord Browne-Wilkinson** | "The sum of the influences that determine decisions in courts of justice." |

---

#### **Marxist Theory of Law**

| Scholar | Viewpoint |
|--------|-----------|
| **Karl Marx** (and followers) | Law is a **tool of oppression**, used by the **ruling class** to control the **working class (proletariat)**. Legal systems are not neutral—they reflect the economic structure and perpetuate class struggles. |

---

#### **Sociological and Other Perspectives**

| Scholar | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **Max Weber** | "Law exists if it is externally guaranteed by the probability of coercion to bring about conformity, applied by a staff of people dedicated to enforcement." |
| **Thomas Hobbes** | In *Leviathan* (1651), law is "the formal glue that holds fundamentally disorganised societies together." |
| **Glanville Williams** | From *Learning the Law*: "Law is the cement of society and also an essential medium of change. Knowledge of law increases one’s understanding of public affairs..." |

---

### Summary Definition

Despite variation, the core function of law remains relatively consistent:

> **Law is a system of enforceable rules and principles, established by society or a sovereign authority, to regulate conduct, resolve disputes, and deliver justice.**

It performs key roles:

- **Regulates behavior**
- **Defines rights and duties**
- **Facilitates orderly change**
- **Protects freedoms and enforces responsibilities**

## Legal System

A **legal system** is the **combination of laws, institutions, processes, and personnel** that work together to administer justice and maintain social order.

### Kenyan Legal System

Kenya’s legal system is based on the **Common Law legal tradition**, inherited from **England** during the colonial period. Before colonization, diverse indigenous communities had their own **customary laws and governance structures** suited to their needs.

### Examples of Legal Systems:

- **Common Law**
- **Civil Law**
- **Islamic Law**
- **Customary Law**

---

## Common Law Legal System

### History of the Common Law

The **Common Law** system originated during the early **Middle Ages** in the **King’s Royal Court (Curia Regis)** at **Westminster** in England. At its inception, the system lacked substantive law and focused largely on **procedural remedies**.

Initially, courts—not the legislature—were the **main law-makers**, and their **decisions became law** through precedent.

---

### Norman Conquest of 1066 A.D

The **Norman Conquest**, led by **William the Conqueror**, profoundly changed England’s political and legal landscape. The conquest transformed wrongs from **private compensable acts** to **public crimes**, often punishable by death or forfeiture.

Key impacts of the Norman Conquest:

- Introduction of **feudalism**
- **Centralized governance**
- Establishment of **bureaucracy** and **record-keeping**
- Retention of **Anglo-Saxon traditions**, such as:
  - **Trial by ordeal or combat**
  - **Jury system**
  - **Outlawry and writs**

Although the Normans had their own laws, they **did not impose Norman law** wholesale in England. Instead, a **new body of rules** emerged, adapted to **local conditions**.

---

### Feudal Land Law

Agriculture was central to England’s economy, making **land** the primary source of wealth. The structure of land ownership followed a **feudal hierarchy**:

#### Feudal Hierarchy:

- **King** – ultimate owner of all land  
- **Tenants in Chief** – granted land by the king  
- **Intermediate Tenants** – known as “mesne” lords  
- **Serfs/Tenants in Demesne** – worked the land under obligation  

Each land holding was subject to a **specific tenure** (payment/service system). The major land interests that emerged were:

- **Fee Simple** – inheritable by any heir  
- **Fee Tail** – inheritable only by direct descendants  
- **Life Estate** – interest lasting only during the holder’s lifetime  

#### Land Transfer:

- Conducted via **formal rituals**, not written deeds  
- Public ceremonies helped **verify and publicize** land transactions

These rules originated in **lords’ manorial courts**, but were later **refined by the King’s Court** (13th century), giving rise to **standardized remedies**.

---

### Development of Centralized Judiciary

A centralized judiciary emerged through:

- **Dominance of Royal Courts**
- **Judges traveling ("on circuit")** to provincial towns  
- Application of **Westminster law** across regions  

Customs were only accepted if **provable and reasonable**, and judges often preferred national law.

By the **13th century**, three royal courts had been established:

1. **The Exchequer**
2. **The Court of Common Pleas**
3. **The King’s Bench**

---

### Henry II’s Reforms

**King Henry II** (reigned 1154–1189) inherited a fractured kingdom and sought **legal uniformity**. His reforms included:

- Centralization of **justice** under the **crown**
- Creation of a **professional judiciary**
- Deployment of **itinerant judges** to apply Westminster laws nationwide

As a result, **local customs** gave way to **national uniform laws**, hence the term **“Common Law”**.

---

### Written Decisions and Precedent

Court decisions were gradually **documented and published**, creating **precedents**. This led to the development of:

- **Stare decisis** (the doctrine of judicial precedent)
- Use of **past rulings** to decide present and future cases

---

### Social Impact

Before the rise of courts, **violence and vendetta** were common means of resolving disputes.

The **Common Law system** introduced:

- **Peaceful dispute resolution** through judicial processes  
- Legal remedies in:
  - **Contracts**
  - **Debt**
  - **Land**
  - **Crime**

This transformation significantly contributed to **social order** and **institutional stability**.

---

## Main Characteristics of the Common Law Legal System

The **Common Law system** possesses a set of unique characteristics that distinguish it from other legal systems such as **Civil Law**, **Islamic Law**, and **Customary Law**. These characteristics are foundational in shaping both the **structure** and **application** of law in Common Law jurisdictions.

---

### 🧑‍⚖️ Case Law

One of the most defining features of the common law tradition is its reliance on **case law**—legal rules developed by **judges through judicial decisions**. In Common Law systems, particularly before legislative dominance, judges were **primary law-makers**.

While legislatures have now become the main sources of legal rules, **judicial decisions continue to evolve the law** in areas such as torts, contracts, and constitutional interpretation.

---

### 🏛️ Role of Judges

Judges in Common Law systems function as **impartial umpires**. They listen to both parties, evaluate evidence presented, and **decide the case based on arguments made in court**. Unlike judges in Civil Law systems, Common Law judges:

- Do not independently investigate facts  
- Rely on evidence and legal arguments presented by the **lawyers**  
- Maintain neutrality between the prosecution and defense  

This structure gives rise to the **adversarial nature** of proceedings in Common Law jurisdictions.

---

### 📜 Doctrine of Stare Decisis (Judicial Precedent)

**Stare decisis** is a **core doctrine** in Common Law. It translates from Latin as:

> **"To stand by things decided and not to disturb the settled."**

In simple terms, courts are bound to follow legal principles laid down in **previous judicial decisions**, particularly from **higher courts**. This promotes:

- **Consistency**  
- **Predictability**  
- **Judicial efficiency**

#### 💬 Scholarly Definition:
> "The rule of adherence to judicial precedents finds its expression in the doctrine of stare decisis. This doctrine is simply that, when a point or principle of law has been once officially decided... it will no longer be considered as open for examination... unless it be for urgent reasons in exceptional cases."  
> — *William M. Lile et al.,* _Brief Making and the Use of Law Books_, 3rd Edition, 1914

---

### 🧭 Categories of Stare Decisis

Stare decisis can be categorized into three distinct types:

#### 1. Horizontal Stare Decisis  
A court follows **its own prior decisions** unless there's a strong justification to depart.  
- In **Kenya**, horizontal stare decisis is **not strictly binding** due to Article 163(7) of the Constitution:

> "All courts, other than the Supreme Court, are bound by the decisions of the Supreme Court."

- Implication: The Supreme Court may **depart from its own decisions**, and by analogy, so may the Court of Appeal and High Court.

#### 2. Super Stare Decisis  
Under this theory, courts follow previous decisions **regardless of their correctness**, often to preserve legal stability. It is rare and controversial because it **prioritizes consistency over accuracy**.

#### 3. Vertical Stare Decisis  
This principle binds **lower courts to follow decisions** from **higher courts** in the same jurisdiction.  
- E.g., In Kenya, all lower courts must follow decisions from the **Court of Appeal** and **Supreme Court**.

---

### ⚖️ What is Ratio Decidendi?

**Ratio decidendi** means *"the reason for the decision"*. It refers to the **legal principle or rule of law** upon which a judicial decision is founded.

#### Black’s Law Dictionary Definition:
- "The principle or rule of law on which a court’s decision is founded."
- "The rule without which a case would have been decided differently."

💡 *Ratio decidendi* is **binding precedent**, whereas **obiter dicta** (statements made in passing) are **persuasive only**.

---

### 👨‍💼 Role of Lawyers

Lawyers in the Common Law system perform crucial, dynamic functions. Unlike Civil Law systems, where judges investigate facts, **lawyers in Common Law adversarial trials**:

- **Cross-examine witnesses**
- **Investigate and present evidence**
- **Formulate legal strategy**
- **Advocate** vigorously on behalf of clients

Their active participation means they **drive the litigation process**, shaping the court’s understanding of both **facts** and **law**.
