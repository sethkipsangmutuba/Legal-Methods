## Introduction

Kenya’s legal system, like many post-colonial jurisdictions, is a hybrid of transplanted European legal traditions and indigenous customary frameworks. The prevailing system is rooted primarily in the Common Law tradition, which was introduced through British colonialism.

## Colonial Legal History

### British Protectorate Status (1895)

Kenya officially became a British protectorate on **1st July 1895**, which marked a major turning point in the establishment of a formal legal structure. This brought an influx of British nationals and Indian colonial administrators who enforced British legal norms exclusively among themselves.

### Reception of English Law (1897)

In **1897**, English law was formally "received" into Kenya. The governing legal principle was that:

> "So far as circumstances admit... in conformity with the Civil Procedure and Penal Codes of India and the other Indian Acts which are in force in the Colony... and subject thereto and so far as the same shall not extend or apply shall be exercised in conformity with the substance of the common law, the doctrines of equity and the statutes of general application in force in England on the 12th day of August 1897."

This clause—commonly known as the *Reception Clause*—established a dual reference system to Indian statutes and English common law doctrines.

However, a **proviso** to the clause stipulated:

> "... shall be in force in the colony so far only as the circumstances of the colony and its inhabitants permit and subject to such qualifications as local circumstances render necessary."

This was intended to ensure that English law would be applied with cultural and environmental adaptations. In practice, this seldom occurred.

### Lord Denning and the Interpretation of English Law

In **Nyali Ltd. v. Attorney-General [1955] 1 A.E.R. 646**, Lord Denning made a crucial observation:

> "You cannot transplant [English law] to the African continent and expect it to retain the tough character which it has in England... It will flourish indeed but it needs careful tending."

Denning highlighted the failure of colonial judges to adapt the law to local realities, calling for a more culturally responsive application of English law in African jurisdictions.

---

## East African Orders in Council

### 1902 Order in Council

This decree extended Indian legal statutes to Kenya, reinforcing the hybrid legal character of the protectorate. Article 15 reiterated:

> "... all civil and criminal jurisdiction shall, so far as circumstances admit, be exercised in conformity with the Indian Acts... and where not applicable, by common law, equity and statutes of general application in England as of 12th August 1897."

### 1911 Amendment

The **1911 Order in Council** reaffirmed the 1902 provisions, maintaining the mixed application of Indian statutory law and English common law.

---

## Colonial Court Systems

### Supreme Court

The **Supreme Court** was created to administer **English law**, staffed with British-trained professional judges. Its purpose was to serve European and Indian colonial populations.

### Subordinate Courts

Below the Supreme Court were **Resident Magistrates' Courts** and **District Magistrates' Courts**. While some Resident Magistrates were trained lawyers, most magistrates were administrative officials like **District Commissioners** and **Provincial Commissioners**, not legal professionals.

### Dual Court System

The system was fundamentally **bifurcated**:

- One set of courts for **Europeans and Asians** (administering English law)  
- Another for **Africans** (administering customary law through Native Tribunals)

---

## Native Court Systems

### Native Tribunals Ordinance

The **Native Tribunals** were formal courts for administering African customary law. Section 13(a) provided:

> "... the native law and custom prevailing in the area of the jurisdiction of the tribunal, so far as it is not repugnant to justice or morality..."

This clause echoed a **repugnancy test**—customary laws would only be valid if they did not contradict English norms of justice and morality.

### Kenya Colony Order in Council, 1921

Article 4(2) stated:

> "In all cases civil and criminal to which natives are parties, every court... shall be guided by native law and custom so far as it is applicable and is not repugnant to justice or morality..."

This marked a limited recognition of customary law even in formal colonial courts.

#### Appeal Structure

Appeals from **Native Tribunals** followed this path:

1. Native Tribunal  
2. Native Court of Appeal  
3. District Commissioner  
4. Provincial Commissioner

This layered, bureaucratic system maintained strict colonial oversight of indigenous justice mechanisms.

---

## Reforms: African Courts Ordinance (1951)

The **1951 Ordinance** replaced the term *Native Tribunals* with **African Courts** to align with changing political sentiments.

### Appeal Process

Appeals from **African Courts** moved through:

1. **African Appeal Court**  
2. **District Commissioner**  
3. **Court of Review** composed of:  
   - A chairman of high judicial standing  
   - Chief Native Commissioner  
   - African Courts Officer  
   - One African appointee by the Governor  

These changes attempted to introduce more formality and legitimacy to customary court systems.

---

## Development of Criminal Law

### Indian Penal Code

Introduced early in the 20th century, the **Indian Penal Code** governed Kenya’s criminal law until **1930**. It was then replaced by the **Kenyan Penal Code**, which reflected the English criminal law system adapted to the colony’s needs.

### Native Criminal Jurisdiction

Initially, Native Tribunals applied **customary criminal law** under district officer supervision. Eventually, they gained limited jurisdiction to try certain offences under the Penal Code.

---

## Conclusion

Kenya's legal system evolved under a colonial framework that merged:

- English common law  
- Indian statutory law  
- African customary law  

This **hybrid legal structure** laid the foundation for Kenya’s post-independence legal development. Although colonial-era judges often disregarded local customs, provisions like the repugnancy clause and the advocacy of Lord Denning served as early calls for a more pluralistic and context-sensitive jurisprudence.

Today, Kenya’s legal system remains a **common law** jurisdiction, but it continues to grapple with the legacy of colonial dualism, especially in integrating **customary norms** into a unified national legal framework.

## Sources of Law

Under **Section 3** of the **Judicature Act, Cap. 8**, Kenyan courts must apply:

1. **The Constitution**  
2. **Written laws**, including Acts of UK Parliament (Part I Schedule), as modified (Part II)  
3. Where written laws do not apply, the **substance of common law**, doctrines of equity, and statutes of general application in force in England on **12 August 1897**, adapted as circumstances permit  

Customary law may guide decisions if not repugnant to justice or morality and not inconsistent with written law (**Section 3(2)**).  

Under **Articles 2(5) & 2(6)** of the Constitution, **international law** and **ratified treaties** form part of Kenyan law.

Key UK statutes in Part I of the schedule include:

- Admiralty Offences (Colonial) Act 1849  
- Evidence Act 1851 (ss. 7 & 11)  
- Foreign Tribunals Evidence Act 1856  
- Evidence by Commission Act 1859 & 1885  
- British Law Ascertainment Act 1859  
- Admiralty Offences (Colonial) Act 1860  
- Foreign Law Ascertainment Act 1861  
- Conveyancing (Scotland) Act 1874 (s.51)  

These statutes operate at the same level as Kenyan laws; reforms via the **Law Reform Commission** have been recommended to localize them.

## Court System Hierarchy

Kenyan courts are structured in the following order, pursuant to **Article 162**:

- **Supreme Court**  
- **Court of Appeal**  
- **High Court** and **Courts with High Court status** (Environment & Land Court; Employment & Labour Relations Court)

- Must concern **county government matters**  
- Only **national or county governments** may request an advisory opinion  
- Court may decline if the issue is pending elsewhere unless in **public interest and urgent**

---

## Summary

Kenya’s current legal architecture reflects a hybrid legacy:

- The **Judicature Act** formalizes sources of law—Blending Constitution, statutes, common law, customary and international law  
- The complex court hierarchy preserves **specialist courts** with High Court status  
- Subordinate courts and tribunals fill niche roles within criminal, civil, customary, and religious law  

This structure allows adaptation to local realities while maintaining alignment with constitutional mandates and international norms.
