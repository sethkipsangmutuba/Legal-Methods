## Legal System

A **legal system** is a combination of laws and the institutions, processes, and personnel involved in the enforcement and operation of those laws.

The most prominent legal systems include:

- Common law
- Civil law
- Islamic law
- Customary law

### The Kenyan Context

The legal system of Kenya is **common law**, which was transplanted from England through colonisation. Before colonisation, various societies in Kenya had their own indigenous laws and systems of governance within distinct territories.

## Common Law Legal System

### History of the Common Law

Common law originated during the early Middle Ages in the **King’s Royal Court (Curia Regis)** located at Westminster near London. Initially, common law focused on procedural remedies rather than substantive laws. Until the 19th century, courts—not the legislature—were responsible for producing law.

---

### Norman Conquest of 1066 A.D

The **Norman Conquest**, led by William, Duke of Normandy, significantly reshaped the British Isles. It resulted in centralization of governance, emergence of feudalism, and implementation of written records.

Before 1066, Anglo-Saxon law (inspired by Germanic tribal laws) governed society. Justice was highly localized, church-influenced, and based on compensation rather than punishment.

Post-conquest developments:

- Serious wrongs became public crimes.
- Land was granted to feudal vassals of the King.
- Bureaucracy and centralized rule emerged.

Some Anglo-Saxon elements survived:

- Trial by jury and ordeal
- Outlawry (placing individuals beyond legal protection)
- Writs (orders to appear in court)

While the Normans brought their own legal customs, these were not wholly transplanted; instead, a hybrid system evolved based on local needs.

---

#### Feudal Land Law

The **English economy** during this era relied on agriculture, and thus, land was wealth.

**Hierarchy of landholding:**

- **King** – Top of the chain and legal owner.
- **Tenant in Chief** – Landholders granted land by the king.
- **Intermediate Tenants** – (Mesne lords)
- **Serfs (Tenants in Demesne)** – Occupants of the land.

Land Tenure was linked to obligations or services. Key types of **estates in land**:

- **Fee Simple** – Inheritable by any heir.
- **Fee Tail** – Inheritable by direct descendants only.
- **Life Estate** – Lasts for the duration of the holder’s life.

Transfers were done through **rituals**, not written deeds.

---

#### Development of Centralized Judiciary

The **Norman courts** evolved from the earlier Saxon Witan, now with broader judicial powers. Royal judges rode **circuits** to provincial towns, applying Westminster law.

By the **13th century**, three royal courts emerged:

- **The Exchequer**
- **The Court of Common Pleas**
- **The King’s Bench**

Local customs were often overruled unless proven reasonable. This led to the emergence of **uniform national law**—the essence of common law.

---

### The Reign of Henry II and Changes in Common Law

**Henry II (r. 1154)** inherited a fractured realm and sought to restore order through law reform.

Key developments:

- Judges were centralized at Westminster or sent on circuit to spread royal justice.
- A single national system of law was promoted.
- Regional customs were replaced by uniform laws.

---

### Written Decisions and Judicial Precedent

Judicial decisions began to be **recorded** and **published**, allowing others to cite past rulings. This practice gave rise to the **doctrine of judicial precedence (stare decisis)**.

---

### Contribution to Social Order

Before common law courts, disputes were often resolved violently or through **vendetta**. The introduction of a formal justice system reduced violence and improved **social order**.

Common law courts provided dispute resolution for:

- Contracts
- Property
- Crime
- Debt recovery

---

## Main Characteristics of the Common Law Legal System

---

### Case Law

In common law systems, much of the law is developed by **judges** through their decisions, which become binding precedent.

---

### Role of Judges

- Judges act as **neutral referees**.
- Cases are argued by lawyers, and judges make rulings based on evidence.
- The system is **adversarial**, unlike the **inquisitorial** civil law system.

---

### Stare Decisis

**Stare decisis et non quieta movere**: "To stand by things decided and not to disturb settled matters."

This doctrine ensures **consistency and predictability** in the law.

> “The rule of adherence to judicial precedents finds its expression in the doctrine of stare decisis...”  
> — William M. Lile et al., *Brief Making and the Use of Law Books*, 3rd ed., 1914

---

#### Horizontal Stare Decisis

A court follows its **own previous decisions** unless there is compelling reason to deviate.

In **Kenya**, strict horizontal stare decisis is not mandatory due to **Article 163(7)** of the Constitution:

> "All courts, other than the Supreme Court, are bound by the decisions of the Supreme Court."

This implies that:

- The **Supreme Court** is not bound by its own previous decisions.
- Similar flexibility may apply to the **Court of Appeal** and **High Courts**.

---

#### Super Stare Decisis

A rare form of the doctrine requiring **absolute adherence** to past decisions—regardless of their correctness.

---

#### Vertical Stare Decisis

Requires **lower courts** to follow rulings of **higher courts** within the same legal hierarchy.

---

#### Ratio Decidendi

Latin for "**the reason for deciding**"

According to **Black’s Law Dictionary**:

> “The rule of law on which a later court thinks that a previous court founded its decision.”

It forms the **binding part** of a judgment and must be followed as precedent.

---

### Role of Lawyers

Lawyers play a central role in:

- Presenting arguments
- Cross-examining witnesses
- Collecting and challenging evidence

Their active role defines the adversarial nature of the common law system.

---

## Summary

The **common law legal system** is deeply historical, shaped by conquest, feudalism, and judicial innovation. Its core strength lies in its adaptability, judicial development of law, and firm adherence to precedent. Despite colonisation, Kenya inherited and integrated this system into its own legal structure, building upon its adversarial principles and hierarchical structure of binding decisions.
