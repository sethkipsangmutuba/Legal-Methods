## 1. History and General Principles

- **Islam** is traced back to the Prophet **Muhammad**, born in **Mecca** (modern-day Saudi Arabia).
- At the time, other religious legal texts like the **Jerusalem Talmud** already existed.
- Muhammad began receiving revelations over a **23-year period**.
- His wife **Khadija** encouraged him to proclaim the revelations publicly.
- These revelations became the foundation of **Islamic law**, known as **Shari’a** (Arabic: "way of life").

---

## 2. Sharia Law

- Sharia is the **totality of Islamic law** governing both private and public life.
- The revelations Muhammad received were recorded on various materials (e.g. leather, pottery, palm stems, bones).
- These writings were later compiled into the **Qur’an**, containing **6,000+ verses**.
- Sharia covers a wide range of legal and ethical matters including:

  - Criminal Law  
  - Marriage & Divorce  
  - Inheritance  
  - Personal Status  

---

## 3. Sources of Sharia

The primary sources of Islamic law, ranked by authority, are:

1. **Koran (Qur’an)**
2. **Sunna**
3. **Ijma**
4. **Qiyas**

---

### 3.1 Koran (Qur’an)

- The **Qur’an** is the supreme source of Islamic law.
- It is considered to be the **literal word of God**, revealed directly to the Prophet Muhammad.
- All other sources of Sharia law serve to explain, interpret, or extend the Qur’an’s teachings.

---

### 3.2 Sunna

- **Sunna** refers to the **way or path** of the Prophet Muhammad.
- It comprises **explanations and interpretations** of the Qur’an by the Prophet.
- The Sunna is preserved through **Hadith** – a collection of narrations about the Prophet’s words and actions.

#### Hadith Components:
1. **The Normative Statement** – what the Prophet said or did.
2. **The Isnad (Chain of Transmission)** – the list of individuals who passed down the Hadith.

- **Reliability** of a Hadith is judged by the **authenticity of its transmission chain**, not necessarily its wisdom.
- Due to controversies over writing Hadith, some were not recorded, while others were fabricated over time.
- Islamic scholars developed systems to **classify** Hadith (e.g., *Sahih*, *Daif*, *Hasan*).

---

### 3.3 Ijma

- **Ijma** is the **consensus** of Islamic scholars on a legal issue.
- It developed about **100 years after Muhammad’s death**, amidst theological and legal debates.
- **Ijma** becomes a binding legal source once a group of scholars reach **unified agreement** on an issue.
- It does **not require universal agreement**, but represents consensus within **schools of thought**.
- Once sanctioned, an Ijma ruling ranks just below the Qur’an in authority.

---

### 3.4 Qiyas

- **Qiyas** refers to **analogical reasoning**.
- It is used when:
  - The Qur’an is silent.
  - The Sunna is unclear.
  - No Ijma exists on the issue.
- Qiyas allows scholars to apply known rulings to **new situations** through analogy.
- It serves as a **bridge** between strict literal interpretation and practical application of the law.
- Like Ijma, Qiyas must eventually be **approved by religious authority** to avoid pluralism in Islamic legal thinking.

> "_Sharia is more than a legal system — it is a complete way of life. It integrates moral, spiritual, social, and legal elements, rooted in divine revelation and community consensus._"
