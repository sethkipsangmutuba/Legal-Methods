## 1. History and General Principles

- **Islam** is traced back to the Prophet **Muhammad**, born in **Mecca** (modern-day Saudi Arabia).
- At the time, other religious legal texts like the **Jerusalem Talmud** already existed.
- Muhammad began receiving revelations over a **23-year period**.
- His wife **Khadija** encouraged him to proclaim the revelations publicly.
- These revelations became the foundation of **Islamic law**, known as **Shari’a** (Arabic: "way of life").

---

## 2. Sharia Law

- Sharia is the **totality of Islamic law** governing both private and public life.
- The revelations Muhammad received were recorded on various materials (e.g. leather, pottery, palm stems, bones).
- These writings were later compiled into the **Qur’an**, containing **6,000+ verses**.
- Sharia covers a wide range of legal and ethical matters including:

  - Criminal Law  
  - Marriage & Divorce  
  - Inheritance  
  - Personal Status  

---

## 3. Sources of Sharia

The primary sources of Islamic law, ranked by authority, are:

1. **Koran (Qur’an)**
2. **Sunna**
3. **Ijma**
4. **Qiyas**

---

### 3.1 Koran (Qur’an)

- The **Qur’an** is the supreme source of Islamic law.
- It is considered to be the **literal word of God**, revealed directly to the Prophet Muhammad.
- All other sources of Sharia law serve to explain, interpret, or extend the Qur’an’s teachings.

---

### 3.2 Sunna

- **Sunna** refers to the **way or path** of the Prophet Muhammad.
- It comprises **explanations and interpretations** of the Qur’an by the Prophet.
- The Sunna is preserved through **Hadith** – a collection of narrations about the Prophet’s words and actions.

#### Hadith Components:
1. **The Normative Statement** – what the Prophet said or did.
2. **The Isnad (Chain of Transmission)** – the list of individuals who passed down the Hadith.

- **Reliability** of a Hadith is judged by the **authenticity of its transmission chain**, not necessarily its wisdom.
- Due to controversies over writing Hadith, some were not recorded, while others were fabricated over time.
- Islamic scholars developed systems to **classify** Hadith (e.g., *Sahih*, *Daif*, *Hasan*).

---

### 3.3 Ijma

- **Ijma** is the **consensus** of Islamic scholars on a legal issue.
- It developed about **100 years after Muhammad’s death**, amidst theological and legal debates.
- **Ijma** becomes a binding legal source once a group of scholars reach **unified agreement** on an issue.
- It does **not require universal agreement**, but represents consensus within **schools of thought**.
- Once sanctioned, an Ijma ruling ranks just below the Qur’an in authority.

---

### 3.4 Qiyas

- **Qiyas** refers to **analogical reasoning**.
- It is used when:
  - The Qur’an is silent.
  - The Sunna is unclear.
  - No Ijma exists on the issue.
- Qiyas allows scholars to apply known rulings to **new situations** through analogy.
- It serves as a **bridge** between strict literal interpretation and practical application of the law.
- Like Ijma, Qiyas must eventually be **approved by religious authority** to avoid pluralism in Islamic legal thinking.

  
---

### 1. Pre-Colonial Era

- The **Sultanate of Zanzibar** extended to the Kenyan coast before colonization.
- Sharia law was introduced formally through the **Native Coast Regulations of 1897**, under the **East African Order in Council, 1897**.

---

### 2. Colonial Era

- The **Mohammedan Marriage, Divorce and Succession Act, 1920** was the first legal recognition of Islamic personal law in colonial Kenya.

---

### 3. Post-Colonial Era

- Kenya’s legal system is **plural**, recognizing **common law**, **customary law**, and **Islamic law**.
- The **Constitution of Kenya, 1963**, under Sections **65** and **66**, recognized **Kadhis’ Courts**.
- The **Kadhis’ Courts Act, 1967**, was enacted to operationalize this constitutional provision.

---

### 4. Kadhis’ Courts

#### 4.1 Establishment and Jurisdiction

- Article **170(1)** of the **Constitution of Kenya, 2010**, establishes the **office of the Chief Kadhi**.
- Article **170(5)** restricts Kadhis' Courts to:
  > "Questions of Muslim law relating to personal status, marriage, divorce or inheritance, in proceedings where all parties profess the Muslim religion and submit to the jurisdiction."

#### 4.2 Qualifications of a Kadhi

A Kadhi must:
- Profess the Muslim faith.
- Be knowledgeable in the applicable Muslim law (as judged by the **Judicial Service Commission**).

---

### 5. Kadhis’ Courts Act

- Enacted in **1967**, it governs the **jurisdiction and structure** of Kadhis’ Courts.
- Section 5 of the Act mirrors the constitutional limitation of jurisdiction:
  > Only applies where **all parties are Muslim** and the subject matter involves **personal status, marriage, divorce, or inheritance**.
- **Does not limit** the jurisdiction of the **High Court** or **subordinate courts** on related matters.

---

### 6. Sources of Sharia in Kenya

- No **codified Sharia** exists in Kenya.
- Kadhis apply **interpretations from Islamic schools of thought**.
- This contrasts with countries like **Egypt** and **Sudan**, where Islamic personal law is codified.

---

### 7. Comparative Jurisdictions

#### 7.1 Egypt

- Early 20th-century efforts at codification.
- **Act No. 25 of 1925** and later **Act No. 25 of 1929** restricted Sharia to the four Sunni schools (Hanafi, Maliki, Hanbali, Shafi’i).
- Attempts at reform (e.g., wife's permission for polygamy) were rejected.

#### 7.2 Sudan

- **1902 Ordinance** provided for Kadhis' Courts.
- **Judiciary Act of 1973** merged Sharia and civil courts.
- In **1991**, Sudan enacted the **Law of Personal Status**, based on **Hanafi** jurisprudence with reference to **Maliki**.

---

### 8. Codification Challenges in Kenya

- No successful attempt to codify Islamic personal law.
- **Individual Kadhis** interpret and apply Islamic law independently.
- Because Kadhis’ Courts are **subordinate**, their decisions **do not set binding precedent**.
- Appeals to **High Court** and above can create precedent, but judges are often **non-Muslim** and may **lack deep understanding** of Islamic law.

---

### 9. Case Law on Personal Status

#### 9.1 Marriage

- In *Ramadhan Mustafa v. Zulfa Ngasia Juma (2019) eKLR*:
  - Quran (2:221) cited on **interfaith marriage**.
  - Muslim men can marry women of other faiths, but not vice versa.

- In *FBI v. BG (2018) eKLR*:
  - **Bride price** = gift to the bride’s family.
  - **Dowry (mahr)** = personal gift to the bride.
  - Court ordered payment of promised dowry (2 cows = KES 33,000).

#### 9.2 Divorce

- Islamic law recognizes:
  - **Talaq** (repudiation by husband)
  - **Khul’** (mutual consent)
  - **Judicial divorce**

- In Tanzania, talaq is **not recognized**. See *Haruna Makwata v. Fatuma Mselemu (1978) TLR 8*:
  > "A Muslim husband must seek and obtain a **court decree** for divorce."

#### 9.3 Inheritance

- Heirs are categorized as:
  - **Dhawil-il-Furudh** (Quranic Sharers)
  - **Asabah** (Residuaries)
  - **Dhawil-il-Arham** (Distant Kindred)

- In *Succession Cause No. 18 of 2019 (Mwangi Suleiman Kahiu)*:
  - Quranic sharers are given priority.
  - Any remaining estate is distributed to Asabah.
  - Dhawil-il-Arham inherit **only if** the first two are absent.

> **Quran 4:11** outlines:
> - Male gets **double** the share of a female.
> - **Parents**, **children**, and **spouse** have fixed shares.
> - Debts and wills are settled **before** distribution.

---

> _"While Kenya has structurally accommodated Islamic personal law through Kadhis’ Courts, lack of codification leaves room for inconsistencies in application and legal uncertainty."_
