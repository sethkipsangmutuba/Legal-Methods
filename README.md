  # Chapter One: Introduction

## 1.1 Understanding the Legal System

Every society is governed by a framework of rules and institutions that regulate human behavior and resolve disputes. These rules are the foundational elements of what we refer to as a **legal system**—a structured mechanism to manage societal order, deliver justice, and regulate interactions among individuals, organizations, and the state.

### Voluntary and Involuntary Interactions

Legal systems address both **voluntary** interactions (e.g., contracts, marriages, employment relationships) and **involuntary** ones (e.g., criminal acts). For instance:

- In **employment law**, the Employment Act of Kenya, 2007 provides protections for employees and outlines employer obligations.
- In **criminal justice**, the Kenyan Penal Code (Cap. 63) and the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 75) govern prosecution, investigation, and punishment of offenders.

## 1.2 Global Legal Systems

Legal systems vary globally due to historical, cultural, religious, and socio-political contexts. The most prominent systems include:

- **Common Law System**: Based on precedent and judicial decisions.
- **Civil Law System**: Based on codified statutes.
- **Islamic Law (Sharia)**: Based on Islamic religious texts.
- **Customary Law**: Rooted in traditions and customs of communities.

### The Kenyan Legal System

Kenya’s legal system is a **hybrid** rooted in **common law tradition**, inherited from British colonial rule, but also incorporating **customary law**, **Islamic law**, and **statutory frameworks**.

#### Sources of Kenyan Law:
- **The Constitution of Kenya, 2010** – Supreme law of the land.
- **Legislation (Acts of Parliament)**.
- **Judicial Precedents** (stare decisis).
- **Customary Law** (recognized under Article 159(2)(c)).
- **International Law** – Applicable where Kenya has ratified treaties, as per Article 2(6) of the Constitution.

> **Case Example**: *R v Karisa Chengo & 2 Others* [2017] eKLR — The Supreme Court affirmed the hierarchical nature of courts and clarified the jurisdictional authority of superior courts, reiterating the primacy of constitutional structure in Kenya’s legal order.

## 1.3 Objectives of Studying Legal Systems

Upon completion of this course, the learner should be able to:

1. Define and contextualize a legal system.
2. Understand and explain the structure and operation of the Kenyan legal system.
3. Compare global legal systems, emphasizing their philosophical and procedural foundations.
4. Evaluate the practice of law and legal service delivery in Kenya and globally.

---

## 1.4 Defining Law

Law is a concept that resists a singular, universally accepted definition. It is shaped by philosophical inquiry, jurisprudential schools, and societal needs. Below are various perspectives on the definition of law.

### Black’s Law Dictionary Definitions:
1. **A system of rules enforced through social institutions** to govern behavior.
2. **The aggregate of legislation, judicial decisions, and legal principles** applied by courts.
3. **A specific area of legal regulation**, e.g., contract law, tort law.
4. **A judicial or administrative process**, e.g., "submit their dispute to the law".

## 1.5 Theoretical Definitions of Law

| **School of Thought** | **Proponent(s)** | **Definition/Conceptualization** |
|------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Legal Positivism** | John Austin | "A command issued by the sovereign and backed by sanctions." (*Province of Jurisprudence Determined*, 1832) |
| | H.L.A. Hart | Law is a system of **primary and secondary rules**. (*The Concept of Law*, 1961) |
| **Natural Law** | St. Thomas Aquinas | "An ordinance of reason for the common good, promulgated by one who has care of the community." |
| | Aristotle | Law is **"an embodiment of reason."** |
| **Legal Realism** | Oliver W. Holmes | "The prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious." |
| | Karl Llewellyn | "Law is what officials do about disputes." |
| **Sociological School** | Max Weber | Law is coercive **norm enforcement by specialized personnel.** |
| **Marxist Theory** | Karl Marx | Law is an **instrument of class oppression** in capitalist societies. |
| **Modern Jurists** | Lord Browne-Wilkinson | Law reflects **the sum of influences that shape court decisions.** |
| **Functional View** | Glanville Williams | "Law is the cement of society and also an essential medium of change." (*Learning the Law*) |

> **Kenyan Application Example**: In *Republic v Mohamed Abdow Mohamed* [2013] eKLR, the High Court emphasized natural law principles, particularly the sanctity of life, under Article 26 of the Constitution.

## 1.6 Law as a Regulator of Human Conduct

In its broadest sense, **law is the instrument through which societies regulate behavior** to ensure justice, order, and peaceful coexistence. It embodies:

- **Preventive functions** (e.g., criminal laws deter antisocial behavior).
- **Protective functions** (e.g., constitutional rights enforce personal freedoms).
- **Dispute resolution mechanisms** (e.g., courts, tribunals).
- **Facilitative roles** (e.g., contract law enables commerce).

> **Landmark Kenyan Case**: *Mumo Matemu v Trusted Society of Human Rights Alliance & 5 Others* [2013] eKLR — The Court of Appeal upheld the role of law in ensuring accountability and integrity in public office under Chapter Six of the Constitution.

## 1.7 Defining a Legal System

A **legal system** refers to the framework of laws, institutions, processes, and actors involved in the creation, interpretation, enforcement, and adjudication of laws within a jurisdiction.

### Core Elements:
- **Sources of Law** (constitutional, statutory, customary).
- **Judicial Structure** (hierarchical arrangement of courts).
- **Legal Personnel** (judges, lawyers, prosecutors).
- **Procedural Norms** (rules of evidence, criminal/civil procedure).
- **Legal Culture** (societal attitudes, enforcement practices).

> **Comparative Example**:  
> - In the **Common Law** tradition (Kenya, UK, US), judicial precedent is central.  
> - In **Civil Law** jurisdictions (France, Germany), comprehensive legal codes dominate, and court decisions are not binding.

> **Kenyan Legal Milestone**: The promulgation of the **Constitution of Kenya, 2010** fundamentally restructured the legal system—introducing **devolution**, expanding **Bill of Rights**, and mandating **public participation** in governance (Article 10).

## 1.8 Conclusion

Law is both **reflective and constitutive** of society. Understanding the **philosophical foundations** and **institutional architecture** of legal systems is indispensable for any legal scholar. The Kenyan legal system, rooted in **common law** but enriched by **customary** and **constitutional innovations**, presents a dynamic case study for comparative jurisprudence.
